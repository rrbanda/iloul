# Intelligent Loan Underwriting (ILOUL)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the analysis and design documentation for an intelligent loan underwriting system that demonstrates AI agent capabilities within financial services workflows. The project addresses FSI customer requirements for expert assistance, model-as-a-service capabilities, and automated compliance management.

## Documentation Structure

### Phase 1: Business Process Analysis (Current)
- [Use Case Overview](docs/01-use-case-overview.md) - Problem statement and solution approach
- [Comprehensive Process](docs/02-business-process-full.md) - Complete 5-phase mortgage workflow
- [Simplified Process](docs/03-business-process-simplified.md) - Streamlined 3-step demonstration approach
- [Process Flowcharts](diagrams/business-flows/) - Visual workflow representations

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture (Planned)
- AI Agent Design and Integration Points
- System Architecture and Data Flows
- Platform Capability Mapping
- Implementation Specifications

## Key Deliverables

**Business Process Documentation**: Complete analysis of traditional mortgage lending workflows with both comprehensive and simplified approaches for different demonstration scenarios.

**Visual Process Flows**: Mermaid-based flowcharts showing decision points, handoffs, and workflow dependencies that can be version-controlled and easily modified.

## Target Outcomes

- Demonstrate multi-agent AI collaboration in regulated financial services environment
- Showcase OpenShift AI platform capabilities including model-as-a-service, trusted AI, and container orchestration
- Provide realistic but accessible demonstration of intelligent process automation
- Establish foundation for FSI customer engagement and technical discussions

## Current Status

**Phase 1 WIP**: Business process analysis and workflow documentation ready for stakeholder review and validation.

**Next Steps**: Pending stakeholder feedback on business process understanding before proceeding with AI agent architecture and technical implementation design.
